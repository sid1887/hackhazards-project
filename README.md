# 🚀 Cumpair - Local & Hypermarket Price Comparison

> Empowering consumers with real-time price comparisons between local stores and major hypermarkets.

## 📌 Problem Statement

**Problem Statement: Transform the Future of Retail Shopping Experience**

---

## 🎯 Objective

Cumpair addresses the challenge consumers face when trying to find the best prices for products across different retailers. By allowing users to input product details via text or barcode scanning, our application delivers real-time price comparisons between local stores and major hypermarkets like Dmart, Pai, Reliance Mart, Amazon, and Flipkart.

Our solution serves budget-conscious shoppers, enabling them to make informed purchasing decisions based on accurate price data, saving both time and money while promoting fair market competition.
